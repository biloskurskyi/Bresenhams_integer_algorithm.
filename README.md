Bresenham's integer algorithm.  

An algorithm for drawing a segment from one arbitrary point to another on a 32*32 pseudoraster has been developed.   
The pseudo-buffer of the frame is set in the form of a one-dimensional array.    
The demonstration test has an arbitrary number of segments with the beginning in the center of the circle    
(the center of the circle is set arbitrarily within the raster by the user) and ends; which are evenly spaced on the circle.    
Expected output of a list of filled pixels for a given segment.
